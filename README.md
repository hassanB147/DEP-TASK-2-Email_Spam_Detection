**Domain**: Machine Learning

**Program**: Virtual Internship Program powered by Digital Empowerment Pakistan (DEP)

**GitHub Repository**: DEP-TASK#2: Email Spam Detection


**Overview**

This project is part of the DEP virtual internship program, where the objective is to develop a machine learning model that classifies emails as either spam or not spam. The dataset consists of labeled emails, and the task involves building a classifier that can automatically detect spam emails through key machine learning techniques.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing:Cleaning and preparing email text for analysis, including removing punctuation, stopwords, and performing tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Utilizing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical representations.
Modeling: Applying machine learning models such as:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Key Files**

spam_detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation of the spam detection model.

dataset.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model (ensure this dataset is added or linked to in your repository).
